# Minesweeper448

Implementation of the classic minesweeper computer game built using Python3 and PyQt5 binding for Qt v5. It is the first group project for "Group" in EECS 448, Spring 2019 at KU.

## Getting Started

In order to play the game, there are a few prerequisite packages to install.

### Prerequisites

This project relies on both Python3 and the PyQt5 bindings for Qt v5.



To install them on Ubuntu/Debian, open a command line and enter:

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pyqt5
```



On Windows and MacOS, you can download the Python3 stable release at:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/

The binary installers include pip, a python utility to install modules. To use pip to install PyQt5, run:
```
python -m pip install pyqt5
```

### Installing

Once Python3 and PyQt5 are installed, you can download the project as a .zip archive or clone the repository in the command line with:
```
git clone https://github.com/littleg13/Minesweeper448.git
```

To begin the game:
```
cd /Path/To/Game/Directory/Minesweeper448
./main.py
```

main.py has file permissions set to be run as an executable so it is possible to run it from a GUI such as Windows File Explorer or Nautilus by double-clicking the file icon.

## Built With
