Challenges and how they were overcome or dealt with

The first challenge that our group faced was that Ian joined the group after we
had already formed. We had to learn how to incorporate another member onto the
team and delegate tasks effectively.
This ended up not being a difficult challenge. As a whole team, we were able to
delegate tasks evenly because Ian filled the role of writing the back-end which
we had not yet started. It ended up meshing fairly well with the work the rest
of the team had already put in.

The only other significant challenge we ran into was we did not have a design
until halfway through. We had built a CLI version and a base GUI before we had
a layout of what they files and objects would look like.
We ended up spending the majority of our first meeting decided upon the
structure of our project. This limited the amount of work any one person could
put in before this meeting. We ended up overcoming it by sitting down and
drawing out the design for the game.

One final challenge the entire group ran into was that none of the members had
ever use PyQT before this project. PyQT was the GUI toolkit that we used for
the entire GUI and does not have the greatest documentation because it is a
derivative from QT for C++.
We never really overcame this challenge, it was more of a slowing factor for
development. This meant that every group member had to take the time to learn
the semantics of this toolkit as we started to work on it. This was a large
contributing factor to the delayed first week of development.
