# Challenges

The first challenge that our group faced was that Ian joined the group after we
had already formed. We had to learn how to incorporate another member onto the
team and delegate tasks effectively.
This ended up not being a difficult challenge. As a whole team, we were able to
delegate tasks evenly because Ian filled the role of writing the back-end which
we had not yet started. It ended up meshing fairly well with the work the rest
of the team had already put in.

The another significant challenge we ran into was we did not have a design
until halfway through. We had built a CLI version and a base GUI before we had
a layout of what the files and objects would look like together.
We ended up spending the majority of our first meeting deciding on the
structure of our project. This limited the amount of work any one person could
put in before this meeting. We ended up overcoming it by sitting down and
drawing out the design for the game.

The final challenge we faced as a group was using PyQT for our GUI toolkit.
None of us had prior experience using PyQT, and as it is only a binding for
QT in C++, it does not have large amounts of documentation or working examples.
We never really overcame this challenge, but it was more of a slowing factor for
development. This meant that every group member had to take the time to learn
the semantics of this toolkit as we started to work with it. This was a large
contributing factor to the delayed first week of development.
