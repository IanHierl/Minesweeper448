Overall our group worked well together, and we didn't hit any major road blocks. But looking back, there are a couple of things we could have done differently to be more efficient or just make the process more pleasant overall. Our primary fault was not getting started earlier. While we were never worried about being done on time, a large majority of the work was done in the last couple of days before the project was due. In the first week we only had 6 commits and a CLI version of the game. If we had planned specific milestones and when we wanted them done, we could have prevented having to make a big push to finish on the weekend it was due. Besides spacing out the work more, the only other notable issue was not making a plan before we started to code. A CLI minesweeper and some GUI code was written before we had completely decided how we wanted to separate objects or the hierarchy of our class structure. That code was able to be used, but it did need to be retooled and separated. Had we made those decisions before we started, we could have prevented spending the extra time on code reworking.
