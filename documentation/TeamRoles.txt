Description on how work was split between teammates
Our team is comprised of four people: Nick, Grady, Ian, and Cameron. The roles
of each member are as follows:

  Nick:
    Nick was most influential in determining the design of the project,
    including decisions like what language and platforms to use. He was also
    in charge of documentation using the Sphinx, taking lead on the
    implementation and ensuring that all the code was well described.

  Ian:
    Ian was a large contributor to the project, providing the bulk of the
    basic back-end functionality of the game, creating the tiles, describing
    their behavior and interaction with the board class, along with the
    generation of mines on the board.

  Grady:
    Grady was essential in polishing the basic program into a well rounded game.
    After the simple functionality of the game was complete, he added win and
    lose situations, as well as polishing mine generation ensuring an overall
    more pleasant user experience.

  Cameron:
    Cameron did a large part of the front-end work dealing with user interaction
    and bounds checking to ensure the program ran smoothly. He created the base
    layout for the menu and the board classes that allowed the other members to
    view and test their changes.
